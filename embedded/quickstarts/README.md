# Quickstart Playbooks (Placeholder)

Upcoming quickstarts will live here, covering:

- Bare-metal loop integrations with `mb_client_poll_with_budget()` once available.
- FreeRTOS task setups that coordinate RX/TX using stream buffers.
- Zephyr and ESP-IDF components configured via Kconfig/menuconfig.

Each quickstart will include minimal build files, wiring diagrams, and references back to the porting wizard.
