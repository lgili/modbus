# Reference Port Implementations (Placeholder)

Vendor-specific reference ports will reside here, starting with:

- `stm32-ll-dma-idle/` – STM32 LL driver using circular DMA and IDLE line detection.
- `nxp-lpuart-idle/` – NXP LPUART configuration showcasing DMA-based RX with IDLE interrupts.

Each port will eventually include HAL glue, timing tables, and sample projects mirroring the quickstarts.
