# STM32 LL DMA + IDLE Port (Skeleton)

This placeholder documents the intent for the STM32 reference port:

- Configure USART with circular DMA reception and IDLE interrupts.
- Bridge DMA buffers to Modbus RTU transport without copies.
- Provide timing helpers for T1.5/T3.5 across baud rates.

Implementation will ship alongside Gate 20.
