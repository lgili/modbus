# Embedded Integration Toolkit

This directory will host assets that speed up firmware integration:

- **Quickstarts** with ready-to-build examples for common RTOS and bare-metal environments.
- **Vendor ports** that demonstrate DMA + IDLE line UART setups and other hardware-specific glue.
- **Checklists and guides** covering porting workflows and profiling tips.

> **Status (2025-10-05):** The scaffolding is in place; content will land alongside Gates 17â€“20 of the roadmap.
