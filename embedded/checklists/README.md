# Embedded Checklists (Placeholder)

This folder will collect copy-paste checklists extracted from the roadmap, such as:

- DMA + IDLE UART bring-up sequences.
- Profile selection and feature-flag matrices.
- Latency budgeting and watchdog configuration steps.

The initial drafts live in `update_plan.md`; they will migrate here as part of gate deliveries.
