# Embedded Porting Wizard (Draft)

This guide will grow into a one-page checklist that walks integrators through:

1. Selecting the appropriate Modbus profile (TINY / LEAN / FULL).
2. Wiring timers, monotonic clocks, and UART/stream primitives.
3. Enabling diagnostic hooks and footprint measurements for their platform.

Future revisions will include decision trees, tables for DMA/IDLE configuration, and links to ready-made quickstarts housed in this directory.
